Focuses on physical connections on network rather than dynamics of power flow; nearly every edge connects to the largest vertex of each colour type reflects that nearly every transformer edge is incident to the largest component of some voltage level. In other words, transformer edges between two components are rare when neither component is the largest within its respective same-voltage subgraph. Furthermore, we also observe that the thickest edges occur between the largest vertices of each colour type. This reflects that the multiplicity of transformer edges between components is greatest when those components are the largest connected components."

In addition, a diagram was built for an actual planning case of the Eastern Interconnect in North America, which is modeled with 62,605 buses. Fig. 9 shows that the greedy algorithm is much less disruptive to the geographic context, with substations never moving more than 5 km from their original location and only 3% at most for each case moved more than 1 km. More than 90% of substations in each case are not moved at all with the greedy approach. The force-directed algorithm keeps all substations the same size, but that comes at the cost of more significant displacement.

For system operators, educators, and researchers alike, a more intuitive and accessible understanding of a power system’s inner electrical structure is called for. This new portrayal offers new insights on the electrical structure, and voltage performance, of power systems and also shows the distinct qualities of the transmission and distribution systems. E.g. Fig. 5 makes it very clear that these buses are electrically remote, making obvious the difficulties of transmitting reactive power to support voltages there. The lesson is clear: meaningful system representations show important electrical features that would otherwise be passed over, even by sophisticated professionals such as those who authored [83]. Without portraying the 2-D impedance structure of a power system, its voltage performance can only be gauged with cumbersome methods, such as the loadflow studies in [93]. The novel visualization promotes insight and understanding; the traditional diagram impedes these. It should be bore in mind that bus loadings and proximity to generation are also essential in appraising system voltage security, and these are not portrayed in Fig. 9, which exclusively considers impedance structure.","system operators, educators, and researchers",identify best layout for power transfer,static,transmission,30-300,,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,,yes,no,no,no,no,"Talks a lot of historic approaches in graph theory in power networks; The novel techniques given in the present work permit a deeper understanding of the power grid’s role as an interconnected electromechanical system of systems.

Therefore, basecase violations for all real-time and future time points are shown in solid color, and contingencies are shown with a low intensity color, or can be displayed using a color-coded transparency.

If all reactive resources at a station are fully available, hen the pie chart is presented as a circle filled entirely with only one color.

The height of each cylinder is proportional to the number of violations caused by the contingency, while the shading and radius of the cylinder are proportional to the magnitude of the worst violation. The voltage cylinder is stacked on top of the transmission cylinder if a contingency causes both low voltages and overloads (which is the case for two of the contingencies shown in the figure). The doubling coding of the magnitudes of the worst contingent violations by color shade and cylinder radius helps to focus attention on these contingencies. buses with low voltages look more prominent with 3-D cones, designated here as “bus terrain","transmission element loading results; “link lines” between each contingency’s cylinder and the violated elements from that contingency.

The bus voltage value is shownby the position of the dividing line between the two colors. (Fig. 6e) As bus voltage increases, the line moves up in the box until it exceeds the limit, where the color outside the limit changes to the violation color and the box is outlined to show that limits are being exceeded. (Fig. 69 The colors chosen are blue and green, since they contrast with each other are not used elsewhere on the display.","transmission lines and transformers - power flow is encoded as the width of an arrow with direction from real power flow; flows represented as flow limits; The strict geographic layout is modified to show transformers as lines of some minimum length. The encoding of flow as width appears to be a useful natural encoding related to the effect of water flow in a stream. As the amount of flow increases, the stream gets deeper and wider. When too much flow exists, it overflows its banks. This suggests encoding power flow as line width, and power flow limits also as a width. Limits are colored gray, to set them further into the background, while a subdued brown color is used for flow. Because line flows and limits are commonly discussed in terms of apparent power (MVA), apparent power is encoded. However, apparent power has no direction, and direction of power flow is important to the dispatcher. Direction, encoded with an arrowhead, is taken from real power (MW). Line flow and limits are encoded as actual MVA, not as a percentage of limits, using the same scale for every line. The human eye can easily extract the approximate percentage loading from the representation of the actual values, whle the actual flow permits comparison with other overload problems in the system",straight line segments,substations in their approximate location,simple,NA,NA,"The developed visualization permits users to ""see"" the power system in a way that is completely new.

Rapid identification of problems should permit corrective actions to be taken promptly enough to avert certain types of power system collapses.
