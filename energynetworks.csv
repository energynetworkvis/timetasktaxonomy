In addition, a diagram was built for an actual planning case of the Eastern Interconnect in North America, which is modeled with 62,605 buses. Fig. 9 shows that the greedy algorithm is much less disruptive to the geographic context, with substations never moving more than 5 km from their original location and only 3% at most for each case moved more than 1 km. More than 90% of substations in each case are not moved at all with the greedy approach. The force-directed algorithm keeps all substations the same size, but that comes at the cost of more significant displacement. Almost no substations remain untouched by that algorithm, which moves some substations up to 30 km away; Overlaps between lines are reduced significantly by the Delaunay approach, regardless of whether a one-layer or two-layer method is used.",simoke,"substations are drawn on a coordinate system corresponding to a standard unit Mercator projection, where (0, 0) is the intersection of the prime meridian with the equator, the longitude scales linearly to ±1 at the international date line, and the latitude scales non-linearly to ±1 at about the eighty-fifth parallels. drawn as rectangles;Thin rectangles are the typical symbol for buses, and lines of varying thickness and color show the branches, aggregating three-phase conductors and any neutral wires.
