Focuses on physical connections on network rather than dynamics of power flow; nearly every edge connects to the largest vertex of each colour type reflects that nearly every transformer edge is incident to the largest component of some voltage level. In other words, transformer edges between two components are rare when neither component is the largest within its respective same-voltage subgraph. Furthermore, we also observe that the thickest edges occur between the largest vertices of each colour type. This reflects that the multiplicity of transformer edges between components is greatest when those components are the largest connected components."

In addition, a diagram was built for an actual planning case of the Eastern Interconnect in North America, which is modeled with 62,605 buses. Fig. 9 shows that the greedy algorithm is much less disruptive to the geographic context, with substations never moving more than 5 km from their original location and only 3% at most for each case moved more than 1 km. More than 90% of substations in each case are not moved at all with the greedy approach.

For system operators, educators, and researchers alike, a more intuitive and accessible understanding of a power system’s inner electrical structure is called for. This new portrayal offers new insights on the electrical structure, and voltage performance, of power systems and also shows the distinct qualities of the transmission and distribution systems. E.g. Fig. 5 makes it very clear that these buses are electrically remote, making obvious the difficulties of transmitting reactive power to support voltages there. The lesson is clear: meaningful system representations show important electrical features that would otherwise be passed over, even by sophisticated professionals such as those who authored [83]. Without portraying the 2-D impedance structure of a power system, its voltage performance can only be gauged with cumbersome methods, such as the loadflow studies in [93]. The novel visualization promotes insight and understanding; the traditional diagram impedes these. It should be bore in mind that bus loadings and proximity to generation are also essential in appraising system voltage security, and these are not portrayed in Fig. 9, which exclusively considers impedance structure.","system operators, educators, and researchers",identify best layout for power transfer,static,transmission,30-300,,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,"Talks a lot of historic approaches in graph theory in power networks; The novel techniques given in the present work permit a deeper understanding of the power grid’s role as an interconnected electromechanical system of systems.

In a V-6 animation, the power swing is shown with the oscillation of the voltage of each node represented as a change in the vertical direction and the oscillation of the phase angle represented as a change in the horizontal direction.","The P-theta map represents the power system by expressing by width the active power flow of a transmission line. the initial state, the horizontal position of busses are determined in such a way that transmission lines having a large flow are represented by wide vertical lines, and other lines interconnected to them are represented as narrow lines that connect wide lines having a large flow on the left and right. The Q-SV map is a technique that was developed as a method for presenting the state of the reactive power flow in an easy-to-understand way. In a Q-SV map, the arrangement of buses and transmission lines is the same as in P-6 map, and the state of reactive power flow is represented by the four types of lines as shown in Fig. 5. This map helps visualize the reactive power flow in a system.

The final representation combines the two approaches, filling the box from the bottom up with one color, and from the top down with a contrasting hue. The bus voltage value is shqwn by the position of the dividing line between the two colors.

In addition to magnitude, direction of flow is important. While line flow is taken from MVA, direction, encoded with an arrow, is taken from MW (Figure 5). Perhaps WARflow and direction could be similarly encoded, but an effective encoding for presenting both real and reactive power on one display has not yet been developed; When an overload occurs, the color of the arrow changes, and the line flow limits are displayed as a hollow box inside the wow. These visual cues, in addition to the width of the line flow arrow, call attention to overloads
1994: transmission lines and transformers - power flow is encoded as the width of an arrow with direction from real power flow; flows represented as flow limits; The strict geographic layout is modified to show transformers as lines of some minimum length. The encoding of flow as width appears to be a useful natural encoding related to the effect of water flow in a stream. As the amount of flow increases, the stream gets deeper and wider. When too much flow exists, it overflows its banks. This suggests encoding power flow as line width, and power flow limits also as a width. Limits are colored gray, to set them further into the background, while a subdued brown color is used for flow. Because line flows and limits are commonly discussed in terms of apparent power (MVA), apparent power is encoded. However, apparent power has no direction, and direction of power flow is important to the dispatcher. Direction, encoded with an arrowhead, is taken from real power (MW). Line flow and limits are encoded as actual MVA, not as a percentage of limits, using the same scale for every line.

The view of the node shows the physical topology of the network at that panicular bus location. Fig. I shows the digraph representation of IEEE 118 bus system with 5 areas; Basically there are two type of bus nodes. Plain bus nodes are just junction buses. branches, and generators that tie networks together. To signify a plain node, a circle is used. To signify a tie line between area, a rectangle is used, which has an apex either on the top, bottom, or both. An apex to the top of the rectangle would signify to the higher level network, while an apex on the bottom would signify to the lower level of network. Another concept is the use of displayable neumonic names for the nodes (buses or areas). In a small diagram this is a little value, but as network grows to more nodes, the user quickly loose the desire and ability to memorize node names. To represent the bus voltage level, the proposed Kansei technique from Mitsui and Christie [SI is implemented. A color gradation ranging between green and blue indicates the normal operational voltage range. A deep blue indicates the high voltage limit (typically set to 1.05 per unit) and bright green indicates the low voltage limit (typically 0.95 per unit). Dark green indicates the nominal voltage (1.0 per unit). The caution colors (gradation between orange and yellow) are used for the low-voltage violations, which are usually more imponant than over-voltage. More serious violations have more yellow in their color. A color gradation between cyan and pale cyan indicates high voltage violations. Whiter colors indicate that the violation is more serious. Red is avoided because, in power industry, red often indicates the normal state (bus in service, breaker closed) as well as an alert.

The height of each cylinder is proportional to the number of violations caused by the contingency, while the shading and radius of the cylinder are proportional to the magnitude of the worst violation. The voltage cylinder is stacked on top of the transmission cylinder if a contingency causes both low voltages and overloads (which is the case for two of the contingencies shown in the figure). The doubling coding of the magnitudes of the worst contingent violations by color shade and cylinder radius helps to focus attention on these contingencies. buses with low voltages look more prominent with 3-D cones, designated here as “bus terrain","transmission element loading results; “link lines” between each contingency’s cylinder and the violated elements from that contingency.

The reference voltage of each bus is represented as a circle in the middle, whose color and size indicate its value, surrounded by two layers of concentric arc areas. The reference voltage value indicates the power delivery ability of buses. The larger the reference voltage, the more electricity can be delivered by this bus. The timeline of the inner and outer arc areas records the temporal evolution of two variables in a clockwise order. Instead of drawing the timeline as a complete circle, we use a circular arc with a gap at the bottom to differentiate the starting and ending time.
